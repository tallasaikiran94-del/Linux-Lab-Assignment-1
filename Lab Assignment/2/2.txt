1)I used the mkdir command to create a new directory named 'documents' in my home directory to serve as a workspace for project files.
2)I used cd to change my working directory to 'documents' and then used the touch command to create an empty file named 'plan.txt'.
3)I used echo combined with the redirection operator (>) to write a sample sentence into 'plan.txt' without opening a text editor.
4)I used ls -l (long listing) to inspect the file's metadata, confirming that my username appears as the owner and checking the read/write permissions.
5)I used the cp command to create an exact duplicate of 'plan.txt' named 'plan_copy.txt' in the same directory.
6)I first navigated back to the home directory (cd ..), then used the mv command to rename the 'documents' directory to 'project_documents'.
7)I used mkdir to create a new subdirectory named 'archive' inside the 'project_documents' folder to better organize older files.
8)I used the mv command to move 'plan_copy.txt' from the main project folder into the newly created 'archive' subdirectory.
9)I used ls with the -R (recursive) flag to display the full structure of 'project_documents', showing contents of both the main folder and the 'archive' subfolder simultaneously.
10)I used the readlink -f command to resolve and print the full canonical absolute path of the 'plan_copy.txt' file.
