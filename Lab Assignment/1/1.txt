1) I used the id command to display my current user identity (UID), group identity (GID), and group memberships to verify my account details.

2) I used pwd to confirm my current working directory and ls -l to list all files with detailed permissions and metadata.

3) I used the echo command combined with the redirection operator (>) to write the specific string into a new file named user_info.txt.

4) I used the wc (word count) command with the -m flag to count and display the number of characters inside user_info.txt.

5) I accessed the manual page for mkdir. One useful option I found is -p (parents), which allows the creation of parent directories if they do not already exist (e.g., mkdir -p folder/subfolder).

6) I listed the contents of the home directory (~) using ls and piped (|) the output to the sort command to ensure the list was arranged alphabetically.

7) I used the grep command to search for the specific string "admin" within the log.txt file and displayed only the lines containing that text.

8) I used the uname command with the -r flag to display the specific release version of the Linux kernel currently running on the server.

9) I used the ping command (limited to 4 packets with -c 4) to test network connectivity to Google's server by sending ICMP echo requests and receiving replies.

10)I used the uptime command to check how long the system has been running. The output displays the current time, the system duration (uptime), the number of logged-in users, and the load averages for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
