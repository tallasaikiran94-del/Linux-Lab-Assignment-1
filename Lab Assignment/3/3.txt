1)I used the echo command to create a new file named sample_data.txt containing a simple text string to use as the source for creating links.
2)I used the ln command (without flags) to create a hard link named sample_hard.txt, which points directly to the same physical data on the disk as the original file.
3)I used the ln command with the -s flag to create a symbolic link named sample_soft.txt, which acts as a shortcut pointing to the filename of the original file rather than its data.
4)I used ls with the -i flag to display the inode numbers, confirming that the hard link shares the same inode as the original, while the symbolic link has a unique inode.
5)sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode number. This is because a hard link is essentially a second name for the exact same physical data blocks on the hard drive, whereas a soft link is a separate file that simply points to the path of the original.
6)I used the stat command to view detailed metadata, including the file size, permissions, access timestamps, and inode number.
7)I used the du (disk usage) command with -h (human-readable) to see the size of directories within my home folder.
8)I used ls with the -lh flags to list all files in the home directory with their sizes displayed in a human-readable format (e.g., KB, MB).
9)I deleted the symbolic link using rm and then used cat to verify that sample_data.txt remained unaffected and readable, proving that deleting a link does not delete the original data.
10)I ran df -h to show the available disk space on all mounted filesystems and du -sh ~ to show the total space occupied specifically by my home directory.
